        	   <p>
        	   Jessie Serrino stays with her foster aunt and uncle on a
        	   farm on Tatooine. She is desperate to get off this planet
        	   and get to the Academy like her friends, but her uncle 
        	   needs her for the next harvest. Meanwhile, an evil emperor
        	   has taken over the galaxy, and has constructed a 
        	   formidable "Death Star" capable of destroying whole 
        	   planets. Princess Leia, a leader in the resistance 
        	   movement, acquires plans of the Death Star, places them in
        	   R2-D2, a droid, and sends him off to find Obi-Wan Kenobi.
        	   Before he finds him, R2-D2 ends up on Serrino's farm with
        	   her friend C-3PO. R2-D2 then wanders into the desert, and
        	   when Jessie follows, they eventually come across Obi-Wan.
        	   Will Jessie, Obi-Wan, and the two droids be able to 
        	   destroy the Death Star, or will the Emperor rule forever?
