Assignment 1

<<<<<<< HEAD

Nearly everything has been correctly implemented 
according to spec. Many of my commits are actually
located in a separate branch that I do not
know how to merge. However, if you are interested
at looking at these, they are located in the
gh-pages branch currently.  


I collaborated with Sarah McDaniel 
and Cameron Jackson, but only to bounce ideas. 
I spent roughly 8 hours on this assignment.

Nearly everything has been correctly implemented 
according to spec. 

My main issue is that nearly all of my commits
are actually located in a separate branch. However,
if you go to my gh-pages branch in my account, you will
see these live updates there.
