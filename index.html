	<div id="description"> <br> Hi, I'm Jessie, and welcome to my page! </br> 
	<br> A bit about me, I recently graduated (February 2015) from Tufts University with degrees in Computer Science and Spanish. </br>  
	<br> I am currently living in Madrid, Spain to complete an intensive course in iOS development. </br>
	<br> In no particular order, I like travel, coding, Spanish, and music. </br>
	<br>If you're a potential employer or a technical recruiter, I would love to hear from you at Jessie.Serrino@tufts.edu. </br>
	<br> Thanks! </br>
