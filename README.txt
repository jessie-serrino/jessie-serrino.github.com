Assignment 1


Nearly everything has been correctly implemented 
according to spec. Many of my commits are actually
located in a separate branch that I do not
know how to merge. However, if you are interested
at looking at these, they are located in the
gh-pages branch currently.  


I collaborated with Sarah McDaniel 
and Cameron Jackson, but only to bounce ideas. 
I spent roughly 8 hours on this assignment.
