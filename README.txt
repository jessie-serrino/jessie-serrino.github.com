Assignment 4

I think I have correctly implemented most of it, and I
had a heavy intent on keeping it modularized. I think
modularization actually made the code a lot more clean.

I created collision detecting and a slightly more advanced than
average scoring system. 

I have included a .gitignore file.

I briefly collaborated with Sarah McDaniel.

Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.
I spent about 20 hours working on this assignment.

Additional features implemented:
- Creatures among the logs that kill you if you touch them
- Updated levels if frogger brings 5 frogs home, and a faster
  game if that occurs.
- An animation if the frog dies
- A timer (this one wasn't fully completed, I just made it for novelty)
