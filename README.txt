Assignment 1

Nearly everything has been correctly implemented 
according to spec. 

My main issue is that nearly all of my commits
are actually located in a separate branch. However,
if you go to my gh-pages branch in my account, you will
see these live updates there.

I collaborated with Sarah McDaniel 
and Cameron Jackson, but only to bounce ideas. 
I spent roughly 8 hours on this assignment.
